# Flowbadges

Flowbadges is an open-source platform created by the Flowers community. This project is particularly significant to me as it was my first experience with Next.js and served as the test project that helped me secure a job at Estúdios Flow, the leading podcast studio in 2022. This project marks an important milestone in my career.
